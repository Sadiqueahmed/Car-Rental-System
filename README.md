# Car Rental System 
 Java OOPs Project - Java Car ðŸš— Rental System Project  | OOP Concepts & Implementation




**The "Car-Rental-System" repository by Sadique Ahmed is a comprehensive Java project that serves as a practical example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in action. This project is designed as a Car Rental System, providing a real-world context for implementing key OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Key Features:
User Interface: The system features a simple command-line interface where users can interact with the program, simulating a basic car rental service.
Car Management: It includes functionalities for managing car information, such as adding new cars, viewing available cars, and updating car details.
Rental Process: Users can rent cars, return them, and the system tracks the availability of each vehicle.
OOP Concepts: The project is structured to highlight how OOP principles can be applied to build scalable and maintainable software. For instance, different types of cars are managed using class hierarchies, and the rental operations are encapsulated within methods.
Technical Details:
Language: Java
Structure: The project is organized into multiple classes that represent different entities and operations within the car rental system. This modular approach enhances code readability and maintainability.
Documentation: The repository includes a README file that provides an overview of the project, along with instructions on how to run the system.
This repository is particularly useful for students and developers looking to understand the practical application of OOP in Java through a hands-on project. It can also serve as a starting point for those interested in building more complex systems based on similar concepts.
